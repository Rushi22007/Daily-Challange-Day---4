# LeetCode Daily Challenge

## Overview
"LeetCode Daily Challenge" is a personal commitment to solve at least one coding problem every day on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). The aim is to develop consistency, improve problem-solving skills, and master coding techniques over time.

## Purpose
The main purposes of this repository are:
- To document daily progress while solving problems on LeetCode.
- To build problem-solving habits and strengthen skills in data structures and algorithms.
- To keep track of solutions for future reference.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Daily Logs:** Each solution will be in its respective folder named by date (e.g., `2025-12-30/`).
- **Solution Files:** Solutions will be provided in multiple programming languages (if applicable). For example:
  - `solution.py` (Python)
  - `solution.cpp` (C++)
  - etc.
- **README.md:** A brief description of the problem and the approach used to solve it (if required).
